## BUSINESS LOGIC RULES

### User Roles
- `seeker` — can apply to jobs, purchase from shop, use Connect.
- `employer` — can post jobs, sell in shop, respond to applications.
- `admin` — moderate platform.

### Jobs & Location System
- **Location Hierarchy:** Location uses a three-level system: country → state → area. All three columns exist on the Job entity. Filters are independent and cascading. The static locations data lives in `apps/api/src/shared/data/locations.json`.
- **Approval Workflow:** Jobs default to `PENDING_REVIEW`. Admin must approve every job to make it `ACTIVE` and visible in public search. When approved, an email is sent to the employer and Redis jobs cache is purged.

### Security
- Admins must use MFA. Employers can optionally enable it.
- Refresh tokens are HttpOnly and SameSite Strict.

### Shop & Escrow System
- **24–48 Hour Auto-Release:** All orders follow a simplified escrow model.
- **Digital Products:** Earnings released immediately after payment confirmation.
- **Physical/Services:** 48-hour auto-release timer starts after seller marks as `delivered`.
- **Commission:** Tutaly takes a flat 20% commission on all shop transactions.
- **Reporting:** Buyers can "Report an Issue" within the 48-hour window, which flags the order and pauses auto-release for admin review.
- **Order Statuses:** `pending_payment` -> `paid` -> `delivered` -> `completed` -> `flagged` -> `refunded`.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
This is a pnpm monorepo. Never use npm or yarn.
`apps/api` contains the NestJS API.
`apps/web` contains the Next.js 14 frontend.

## DATABASE RULES
- **Synchronize: false (LOCKED)**. Never enable `synchronize: true`. All schema changes must use migrations.
- Always generate a migration file for schema changes: `pnpm migration:generate src/database/migrations/DescriptiveName`
- Review the generated migration for security and performance (e.g., missing indices, potential data loss) before running.
- Always add `.take(limit).skip(offset)` for paginated endpoints to prevent unbounded results.

### Mandatory Schema Change Workflow
Before committing any entity changes, follow this 5-step process:
1. **Modify** the entity file (`*.entity.ts`).
2. **Generate** the migration: `pnpm migration:generate src/database/migrations/DescriptiveName`.
3. **Review** the generated migration file for correctness.
4. **Run** the migration to sync your local/dev database: `pnpm migration:run`.
5. **Commit** both the entity change AND the migration file together. Never commit a partial change.
